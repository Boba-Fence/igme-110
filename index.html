      "I made a short trailer-esque video portraying a road through the wilderness, with a person riding a motorcylce through  it. The video cuts back and forth between the driver and different aerial shots of the forest. To do this, I cut three separate video clips together to make a coherent video, cutting at what I felt were the best moments to make the video make sense."
